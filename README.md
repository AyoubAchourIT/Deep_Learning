# Deep Learning

This repository contains selected deep learning notebooks developed as part of academic coursework and personal study.

The focus is on understanding fundamental concepts rather than using high-level abstractions.

## Contents

### Perceptron — Classification
Implementation of a perceptron model for binary classification.
Includes training dynamics and visualization of decision boundaries.

### Perceptron — Regression
Extension of the perceptron framework to regression tasks.
Explores loss behavior and parameter updates.

### Mathematics of LLMs
Notes and exploratory work on the mathematical foundations of large language models:
- linear algebra foundations
- gradient-based optimization
- attention mechanisms (conceptual level)
- scaling considerations

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document learning progress and core understanding of neural network fundamentals.

It is intentionally notebook-based and focuses on clarity of reasoning over production deployment.
